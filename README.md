Electricity Demand Estimation

To understand demand for electricity for the next 1-2 years to manage the production of electricity and managing the vendors for the same.

**Available data:**
The data of monthly electricity consumption available starting from January 1973 to December 2019.
We need to forecast the demand for next two years.
1. Date – Month & Year
2. Electricity Consumption – Electricity consumption in Trillion Watts

**Objective:**
a. Need to forecast the demand of electricity for next 1-2 years.
b. Calculate error metrics (RMSE, RMSPE, MAPE)
c. Compare various models including Decomposition, ETS models, ARIMA/SARIMA Models with
various parameters etc…
